## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Widget Not Appearing:**
- Check domain matches workspace domain exactly
- Verify trigger rules are met (visit count, time, page targeting)
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Ensure script tag is correctly placed

**Customer Mapping Not Working:**
- Verify customer mapping is enabled in Widget Appearance
- Ensure email field is shown and being collected
- Check that modal flow is set to "Two Modal"
- Confirm email addresses are valid format

**Reviews Not Saving:**
- Check required field validation
- Verify workspace token is correct
- Ensure API endpoints are accessible
- Check server logs for validation errors

### Browser Console Debugging
Open browser developer tools and check for:
```javascript
// Widget loading
"Review Widget: Main widget module loaded successfully"

// Configuration
"ReviewWidget initialized with config: {token: '...', ...}"

// API calls
"ReviewWidget: Tracking visitor..."
"ReviewWidget: Submitting review..."
```

## üîê Security Considerations

- **Domain Validation**: Widgets only work on registered domains
- **Token Authentication**: Each workspace has unique token
- **Input Sanitization**: All user input is sanitized
- **Rate Limiting**: API endpoints have rate limiting
- **HTTPS**: Use HTTPS in production for secure data transmission

## üìä Performance

- **Widget Size**: ~15KB minified JavaScript
- **Load Time**: Async loading, non-blocking
- **API Response**: < 100ms average response time
- **Database**: Optimized queries with proper indexing
- **Caching**: Application-level caching for better performance
